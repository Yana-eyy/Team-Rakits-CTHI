# Hello! We are Group Rakits of CTHI!

We were tasked to make a program that plays the Pig Game.
We first initialize the needed variables as private static so we can use them on any method we coded. After we have initialized the variable, we proceded to make a method for the player's turn. Inside the method PlayerTurn, we use a do-while loop with a nested if statement and also a if-else-if statement. After we have finished coding the PlayerTurn Method, we coded the computer's turn using the PlayerTurn Method as reference. We use the java.util.Random instead of user input. We also use the Time Unit to make the computer input slower so it doesn't happen all at once. We then called out all of our methods in the Main method.
